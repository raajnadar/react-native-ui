# Layout

Layout provides a safe area wrapper with the theme background color applied automatically.

## Usage

```tsx
import { Layout } from '@rn-ui/components/layout'

<Layout>
  {/* Content is inside safe area with theme background */}
</Layout>
```

## Immersive Mode

For full-screen layouts that extend behind the status bar:

```tsx
<Layout immersive>
  {/* No safe area insets */}
</Layout>
```

## Custom Edges

Control which safe area edges are applied:

```tsx
<Layout edges={['top', 'bottom']}>
  {/* Safe area on top and bottom only */}
</Layout>
```

By default, only the `bottom` edge is applied. In immersive mode, no edges are applied.

## Props

<PropTable name="Layout" />
